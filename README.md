## Project Overview

This is a personal spending analyzer built with a FastAPI backend and React frontend. Users can upload CSV files from their bank/credit card accounts to analyze their transactions. 

Note: This is not meant to be a net worth calculator/tracker. This is designed to help users view their spending habits so they can make informed decisions when planning future budgets and managing cash.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Todo**
- **Local first**: Manually upload CSV files rather than connecting to financial institution APIs
- **SQLite**: Simple file-based database suitable for personal use
- **Standardized transaction format**: All institution CSV formats parsed into a singular, consistent Transaction model
- **Category field optional**: Some institutions don't provide categories, users can add manually
- **Frontend analysis**: Data (todo: add pagination for large txn history) is fetched from db on startup and client-side performs analysis


## Architecture

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- **FastAPI** REST API with CORS enabled for frontend communication
- **SQLite** database with **SQLAlchemy** ORM for persistence
- **Pydantic** schemas for request/response validation
- **Uvicorn** ASGI web server - runs the backend
- **Pytest** tests core python modules
- Modular structure: parsers → loaders → database → API endpoints

Core modules:
- `app/models.py`: SQLAlchemy Transaction model
- `app/parsers.py`: CSV parsing logic for different institution formats
- `app/loaders.py`: Data loading functions to move parsed CSV data into database
- `app/database.py`: Database connection and initialization
- `app/schemas.py`: Pydantic models for API validation
- `app/api/transactions.py`: Backend api endpoints for transaction crud, filtering, etc.
- `app/crud/operations.py`: Database CRUD operations


### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **React 19** with **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Vite** as build tool and development server
- **Material UI (MUI)** for UI components, including data grids and dialogs
- **React Query (@tanstack/react-query)** for server state management
- **Axios** for HTTP client communication with backend

Core modules:
- `frontend/src/App.tsx`: root component with QueryClientProvider, ThemeProvider, Header, and Dashboard
- `frontend/src/types/filters.ts` - defines the types of transaction filters available
- `frontend/src/utils/filterValidation.ts` - validates filter inputs (date ranges, amount ranges) before applying
- `frontend/src/utils/filterUtils.ts` - filter operations (equality checks, URL param building, active filter counting)
- `frontend/src/utils/dateUtils.ts` - date parsing, formatting, and manipulation utilities
- `frontend/src/utils/analyticsUtils.ts` - client-side analytics calculations (totals, grouping, formatting, chart data prep)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useTransactions.ts` - transaction CRUD operations and metadata queries (cost centers, spend categories, accounts)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useSpendingAnalytics.ts` - quick client-side analytics calculations on already-fetched transactions
- `frontend/src/hooks/usePendingFilters.ts` - manages unsaved filter state before applying to avoid unnecessary API calls
- `frontend/src/hooks/useFilters.ts` - smart hook that switches between all/filtered transactions based on active filters
- `frontend/src/hooks/useFilterOptions.ts` - fetches and prepares filter dropdown options from backend metadata
- `frontend/src/hooks/useCSVUpload.ts` - handles CSV file uploads with institution selection
- `frontend/src/context/TransactionContext.tsx` - react context providing filter state and whether filters are applied globally
- `frontend/src/components/Header.tsx` - app header with title and navigation
- `frontend/src/components/TransactionTable.tsx` - main transaction display (toggles between data grid and chart)
- `frontend/src/components/Timeline.tsx` - trading View lightweight chart visualization of transaction history
- `frontend/src/components/MoMBarChart.tsx` - bar chart displaying monthly expense totals
- `frontend/src/components/FiltersPanel.tsx` - filter controls for transactions (dates, categories, amounts, search)
- `frontend/src/components/AnalyticsPanel.tsx` - dashboard analytics (pie charts, top categories, stats)
- `frontend/src/components/transactions/TransactionDataGrid.tsx` - MUI DataGrid ledger showing transaction rows
- `frontend/src/components/transactions/TransactionTableHeader.tsx` - active filter tags and action buttons (add, upload, export)
- `frontend/src/components/transactions/FilterTags.tsx` - displays active filters as removable chips
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/TopCategoriesList.tsx` - list of top spending categories with amounts
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/SpendingOverview.tsx` - high-level spending summary cards
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/QuickStatsView.tsx` - quick statistics (count, averages, totals)
- `frontend/src/components/analytics/CategoryPieChart.tsx` - pie chart showing spending by category/cost center
